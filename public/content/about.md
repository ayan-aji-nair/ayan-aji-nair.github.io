# hi there!

i'm a software engineer at [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/firetv/), where i work on firetv. prior to that, i interned at [snowflake](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/guides-overview-ai-features), working on cortex. i also consulted at [morgan stanley](https://www.morganstanley.com/what-we-do/wealth-management?cid=ppc-10827639104:4290014304:112352994931:306504640729&gclsrc=aw.ds&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=10827639104&gbraid=0AAAAADo3gWHmLrPfxpNTiLzNtEbHGAOlS&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI8Jq3sYGokAMVRgetBh1gnx6BEAAYASAAEgJrdvD_BwE), in their wealth management division.

in may of 2025, i graduated from [rutgers university](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/) with a double major in math and computer science (with honors), where i took courses related to deep learning, operating systems / systems programming, algorithms, computational complexity, and pure mathematics.

i love coding. my favorite languages to use are rust, c++, and c. however, i love learning. most recently i've picked up kotlin and go. i'm always looking to learn cool new tech; learning is always fun and i look for any chance i can get to do it!

outside of tech, i am an avid powerlifter and love listening to music ([check out my spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/ayan_nair?si=iU3vzSQsTZuXjtLnOqSKsA)) and writing.
